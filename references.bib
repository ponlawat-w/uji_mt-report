  abstract={A decentralized ride-or carsharing application is among the early proposals of what smart contracts on blockchains may enable in the future. To facilitate use cases in the field of location-based services (LBS), smart contracts need to receive trustworthy positioning information, and be able to process them. We propose an approach on how geofences can be defined in smart contracts, and how supplied positions can be evaluated on whether they are contained in the geofence or not. The approach relies on existing location encoding systems like Geohashes and S2 cells that can transform polygons into a grid of cells. These can be stored in a smart contract to represent a geofence. An oracle run by a mobile network provider can submit network-based positioning information to the contract, that compares it with the geofence. We evaluate the location encoding systems on their ability to model city geofences and mobile network cell position estimates and analyze the costs associated with storing and evaluating received oracle-positions in an Ethereum-based smart contract implementation. Our results show that S2 encodings perform better than Geohashes, that the one-time cost of geofence definition corresponds linearly with the number of grid cells used, and that the evaluation of oracle-submitted locations does not incur high costs.},  keywords={contracts;mobile computing;traffic engineering computing;blockchain;decentralized ride;carsharing application;trustworthy positioning information;city geofences;mobile network cell position;Ethereum-based smart contract implementation;oracle-submitted locations;received oracle-positions;network-based positioning information;decentralized location-based services;geofence definition;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Encoding;Peer-to-peer computing;Urban areas;blockchain;geofences;location based services},

We are representing the new method for objects tagging using synergy mechanism between well known Geohash algorithm and Universally Unique Identifiers we call GHUUID (Geohash+UUID) gaining the agent system spatio-temporal identification of all data available. Multi-Agent systems in their nature strongly rely upon distributed databases across vast amount of data. Some of the interoperability issues are solved with usage of semantic web principles which can be cumbersome to implement and maintain.

  abstract = "Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community."

  ABSTRACT = {The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) represents a fundamental infrastructure and set of techniques that support innovative services in various application domains. Trust management plays an important role in enabling the reliable data collection and mining, context-awareness, and enhanced user security in the IoT. The main tasks of trust management include trust architecture design and reputation evaluation. However, existing trust architectures and reputation evaluation solutions cannot be directly applied to the IoT, due to the large number of physical entities, the limited computation ability of physical entities, and the highly dynamic nature of the network. In comparison, it generally requires a general and flexible architecture to manage trust in such a dynamic environment as IoT. In this paper, we present IoTrust, a trust architecture that integrates Soft Defined Network (SDN) in IoT, and a cross-layer authorization protocol based on IoTrust. IoTrust and the protocol together provide a new insight for research on trust management in the IoT. For trust establishment, we further propose a Behavior-based Reputation Evaluation Scheme for the Node (BES) and an Organization Reputation Evaluation Scheme (ORES). Both our theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the efficiency of BES and ORES.},

All IoT devices (e.g., smart phones carried by humans or smart cars driven by humans) capable of detecting air quality can act as participants and submit sensing reports to the cloud for sensing result aggregation. The major challenge is the selection of trustworthy participants because not all IoT devices will be trustworthy. We leverage a ``Trust as a Service'' (TaaS) cloud utility to address the issue of selecting trustworthy participants. Using real traces of ozone (O3) levels and mobility traces of users in the O3 community of interest (O3COI) group in the city of Houston, we demonstrate that TaaS outperforms contemporary IoT trust protocols in selecting trustworthy participants. We compare the performance of the TaaS cloud utility with two contemporary IoT trust protocols for supporting trust-based IoT participatory sensing applications. With the help of the TaaS cloud utility, a user in this O3COI group is able to obtain O3 readings very close to the ground truth O3 level despite 30{\%} participants are untrustworthy.},

  abstract = {We propose trust to enhance security in adaptive and non-intrusive user authentication in controlled and pervasive environments. In addition to who a user is (e.g., via biometrics) and what a user knows (e.g., a password, a PIN), recent authentication solutions evaluate what a user has. The user's identity is then derived from what detectable accredited items (e.g., badges, RFIDs) and personal devices (e.g., smart-phones, PDAs) the user shows when authenticating. The level of security of the access is set consequently. Position information is also considered in authentication; only those users carrying authorised items in proximity of certain places can benefit from available resources at those places. Unfortunately, items such as badges, mobile phones, smart phones, RFID-ed cards can be stolen, forgotten, or lost with a consequent risk of identity theft and intrusion. In controlled environment like buildings, where sensors can detect a wide range of different types of items, the security of authentication can be improved by evaluating the amount of trust that can be reposed on the user standing in the area from where he tries to access a resource. This piece of information can be calculated from the positions of all the items linkable to the requester as sensed along time by the different sensors available. Sensors are seen as recommenders that give opinions on a user being in a requested position depending on what they have perceived in the environment. We apply Subjective Logics to model recommendations that originate from different types of location detectors and to combine them into a trust value. Our solution has been tested to improve authentication in an intelligent coffee corner of our research institute. A user at the coffee corner can see, displayed on a wall screen, the position of his colleagues depending on the level of authentication he obtains. The user authentication level depends on the number and on the quality of tokens he provides when authenticating. We comment how the use of a location-based trust (on the requester standing at the coffee corner) improves the adaptability, the non-intrusiveness, and the security of the authentication process. We validate our proposal with a simulation that shows how location-based trust changes when a user device moves away from the coffee corner.}
